# Browsers

Granted currently supports Firefox, Chromium-based browsers (such as Chrome, Brave, and Edge), Safari and Arc.

:::tip

We recommend using Firefox with Granted as it has the best user experience when accessing multiple cloud consoles, even if it's not your daily driver browser.

:::

On Firefox Granted uses [Multi-Account Containers](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers) to view multiple cloud accounts. Multiple cloud accounts can be opened in the same window and they are color-coded for easy reference. In order to use Granted with Firefox you'll need to download [our Firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/granted/). The extension requires minimal permissions and does not have access to web page content. You can read more about security considerations for the extension [here](/granted/security).

On Chromium-based browsers Granted uses [Profiles](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824). Each cloud account is opened in a separate window.

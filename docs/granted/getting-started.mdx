# Getting Started

This guide will get you started using Granted to assume roles in AWS. It will take around 5 minutes to complete.

## Install the AWS CLI

Although Granted doesn't depend on the AWS CLI, we recommend [installing it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/deploying-granted-install.html) in order to run a test command to verify Granted is working properly.

## Set up your AWS profile file

You will also need to set up at least one role in your [AWS config file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html). On MacOS and Linux, this is stored in `~/.aws/config`. On Windows, this is stored in the `%UserProfile%` directory. Some example configurations are included below.

If you use AWS SSO but you haven't yet configured any profiles, you can run `aws configure sso` which will walk you through the process of setting up your profile file.

**If you've already set up roles for the AWS CLI to access AWS you probably don't need to configure anything: Granted uses the same configuration files as the AWS CLI.**

<summary>Example configuration for AWS SSO (recommended)</summary>
<div>

```
# ~/.aws/config
# Change the values below to match your AWS SSO configuration
# Granted uses the profile name: in this case 'my-profile' to choose the role.

[profile my-profile]
sso_start_url=https://mycompany.awsapps.com/start
sso_region=us-east-1
sso_account_id=123456789012
sso_role_name=DeveloperRole
region=us-east-1
```

More information on using IAM users and roles can be found [here](https://blog.coinbase.com/you-need-more-than-one-aws-account-aws-bastions-and-assume-role-23946c6dfde3).

<div>

```
# ~/.aws/credentials
[base]
aws_access_key_id=<ACCESS_KEY>
aws_secret_access_key=<SECRET_KEY>
```

```
# ~/.aws/config
# Change the values below to match your AWS role configuration
# Granted uses the profile name: in this case 'my-profile' to choose the role.

[profile base]
region=us-east-1

[profile my-profile]
region=us-east-1
source_profile=base
role_arn=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-role
```

## Installing the CLI

In order to use Granted you'll need to install it on your system. Common Fate provides binaries for Granted.

<Tabs
  groupId="operating-systems"
  defaultValue="macos"
  values={[
	  { label: "Homebrew on MacOS", value: "macos" },
	  { label: "Linux", value: "linux" },
	  { label: "Windows", value: "windows" },
	  ]}
>
<TabItem value="macos">

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is an open source package manager for MacOS. We publish a Homebrew formula for Granted. To install Granted with Homebrew, run the commands below in your terminal.

```
brew tap common-fate/granted
brew install granted
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux">

Select the steps which match your system architecture. You can find your architecture by running `uname -m` from a terminal window.

<Tabs
groupId="linux-arch"
defaultValue="x86_64"
values={[
{ label: "x86_64", value: "x86_64" },
{ label: "arm64", value: "arm64" },
{ label: "i386", value: "i386" },
]}

<TabItem value="x86_64">

```
curl -OL releases.commonfate.io/granted/v0.6.0/granted_0.6.0_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
sudo tar -zxvf ./granted_0.6.0_linux_x86_64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="arm64">

```

curl -OL releases.commonfate.io/granted/v0.6.0/granted_0.6.0_linux_arm64.tar.gz
sudo tar -zxvf ./granted_0.6.0_linux_arm64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="i386">

```
curl -OL releases.commonfate.io/granted/v0.6.0/granted_0.6.0_linux_i386.tar.gz
sudo tar -zxvf ./granted_0.6.0_linux_i386.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

First, download the zip archive of Granted which matches your system's architecture. You can find your architecture by viewing your system properties in the Control Panel.

[Granted for Windows x86_64](https://releases.commonfate.io/granted/v0.6.0/granted_0.6.0_windows_x86_64.zip)

[Granted for Windows arm64](https://releases.commonfate.io/granted/v0.6.0/granted_0.6.0_windows_arm64.zip)

[Granted for Windows i386](https://releases.commonfate.io/granted/v0.6.0/granted_0.6.0_windows_i386.zip)

After downloading Granted, unzip the package. Granted runs as two binaries, `assume` and `granted`. Any other files in the package can be removed and Granted will still function.

You'll need to move Granted to a folder that is accessible on your `PATH`. [This StackOverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1618280/where-can-i-set-path-to-make-exe-on-windows) has instructions on how to do this.

If you are using Granted with the [Git Bash shell on Windows](https://gitforwindows.org), we recommend enabling experimental support for pseudo consoles. You may need to reinstall Git For Windows to enable this. You can read more about this [here](https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/404).

</Tabs>

## Verify the installation

You can verify the integrity and authenticity of the Granted binary you have downloaded by running through the [verification process here](/granted/security#release-verification).

To verify that the installation has succeeded, print the version of Granted by running `granted -v`. You should see an output similar to below.

```
âžœ granted -v


Granted v0.6.0

```

If you have any issues installing don't hesitate to [ask for help on our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/commonfatecommunity/shared_invite/zt-q4m96ypu-_gYlRWD3k5rIsaSsqP7QMg).

## Next steps

Now that you've installed Granted, it's time to [assume your first role](/granted/usage/assuming-roles).

# Disabling usage tips

By default, Granted provides built-in tips to help users navigate the tool. However, some may find them distracting or unnecessary. With the latest release of Granted, you can disable this feature with an easy command:

```
granted settings set -s=DisableUsageTips --value true

```

To switch back and enable the built-in tips again, simply set the `DisableUsageTips` value to `false`.

# Deployment setup

## Installing `gdeploy`

To manage our Granted Approvals deployment, we'll start by installing `gdeploy`.

`gdeploy` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for creating and managing Granted Approvals deployments. It provides commands for creating and updating deployments, and also for operational tasks like viewing logs and backing up or restoring data.

To install `gdeploy`, follow the instructions below based on your computer's operating system:

<Tabs
groupId="operating-systems"
defaultValue="macos"
values={[
  { label: "Homebrew on MacOS", value: "macos" },
  { label: "MacOS manual install", value: "macos-manual" },
  { label: "Linux", value: "linux" },
  { label: "Windows", value: "windows" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="macos">

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is an open source package manager for MacOS. We publish a Homebrew formula for Granted. To install Granted with Homebrew, run the commands below in your terminal.

```
brew tap common-fate/granted
brew install gdeploy
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="macos-manual">

Select the steps which match your system architecture. You can find your architecture by running `uname -m` from a terminal window.

<Tabs

First, download the zip archive of `gdeploy` which matches your system's architecture. You can find your architecture by viewing your system properties in the Control Panel.

[gdeploy for Windows x86_64](https://releases.commonfate.io/gdeploy/v0.10.3/gdeploy_0.10.3_windows_x86_64.zip)

[gdeploy for Windows arm64](https://releases.commonfate.io/gdeploy/v0.10.3/gdeploy_0.10.3_windows_arm64.zip)

[gdeploy for Windows i386](https://releases.commonfate.io/gdeploy/v0.10.3/gdeploy_0.10.3_windows_i386.zip)

After downloading gdeploy, unzip the package.

You'll need to move the binary to a folder which is accessible on your `PATH`. [This StackOverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1618280/where-can-i-set-path-to-make-exe-on-windows) has instructions on how to do this.

## Verify the installation

You can verify the integrity and authenticity of the `gdeploy` binary you have downloaded by running through the [verification process here](/granted/security#release-verification) (replacing references to `granted` in URLs with `gdeploy`).

Check that `gdeploy` has been installed correctly by running `gdeploy -v`. You should see a version output similar to the below:

```bash
❯ gdeploy -v
gdeploy version 0.10.3
```

## Setting up your deployment configuration

To start, we're going to create a folder to hold configuration files for your Granted Approvals deployment. Create a new folder on your computer and open a terminal window in it. You can give this folder any name — we suggest calling it `granted-deployment`. In the terminal window, run the following command:

```bash
gdeploy init
```

`gdeploy` will ask some questions to set up your deployments. After you've answered the questions, you should see an output similar to below:

```bash
[✔] wrote config to granted-deployment.yml
```

The `granted-deployment.yml` file contains all of the configuration for your Granted Approvals deployment. Have a look at the file by running `cat granted-deployment.yml`:

```bash
➜ cat granted-deployment.yml
version: 1
deployment:
  stackName: Granted
  account: "123456789012"
  region: ap-southeast-2
  release: v0.10.3
  parameters:
    CognitoDomainPrefix: granted-login-cfdemo
```

During the deployment process, `gdeploy` reads information from this file and uses it to populate [CloudFormation parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html) for the deployment.

:::info
We recommend using `git` to track versions of the `granted-deployment.yml` file. Run the following commands from your deployment folder to set up version control with `git`:

```bash
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "initial Granted deployment configuration"
```

You can publish this repository to a `git` provider like GitHub or GitLab to backup your configuration.

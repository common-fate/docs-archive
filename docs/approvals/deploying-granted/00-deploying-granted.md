# Deploying Granted Approvals

This page is a quickstart guide for setting up a basic Granted Approvals deployment in 5 minutes. If you've got more than 5 minutes, head over to the [Prerequisites](/granted-approvals/deploying-granted/prerequisites) page to read the full guide.

All you need is an AWS account, an AWS profile that has the ability to create resources and IAM roles, and an internet connection. You'll only need to run a few commands. Note that while Granted Approvals requires AWS to host your deployment, your actual Access Providers can also be Azure or Okta based.

First you'll install `gdeploy`, our command-line interface tool for managing Granted Approvals deployments. (not on Mac? [here's](/granted-approvals/deploying-granted/setup#installing-gdeploy) how you install `gdeploy` on other systems)

```
brew install common-fate/granted/gdeploy
```

Next, make a folder to store your Granted Approvals config files and run initialization.

```
mkdir granted-deployment
cd granted-deployment
gdeploy init
```

Now, let's put some stuff in your cloud. Assume the privileged AWS role in the account you wish to deploy Granted Approvals and run:

```
gdeploy create
```

The deployment should take a few minutes to complete. If it's successful, your Granted Approvals deployment will now be online. But you can't use it without a user. Let's make one.

```
gdeploy users create --admin -u YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS
```

You'll get an email with a temporary password. To get the dashboard URL where you can login with the temporary password we can run:

```
gdeploy dashboard url
```

Once that's done, you should see this:

Congrats! You've now 10x'd deploying Granted. If you want more details on what just happened, check out the subpages of this _Deploying Granted_ section.

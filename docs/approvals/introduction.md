The benefits of Granted Approvals are:

**Get access:** set up rules defining who can request access to what, and the resource owners who can approve access.

**Connect with your services:** install Access Providers to provision access to your SaaS services and cloud providers.

**Approve quickly:** connect with your team's communication tools like Slack.

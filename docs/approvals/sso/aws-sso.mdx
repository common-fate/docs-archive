# AWS IAM Identity Center (Formerly Single Sign On)

## AWS IAM Identity Center setup

To set up AWS IAM Identity Center as your identity provider for Granted Approvals you will need to create an IAM role in the management account of your AWS organization that has a trust relationship with the Granted Approvals deployment.

This role required has a minimal set of IAM permissions which only allow it to read information about your users and groups.

### Creating an IAM Role

Follow either the Cloudformation process to deploy this role, or you can use the JSON policy template directly if you would prefer to deploy this role using a custom process.

<Tabs
  groupId="deployment-strategy"
  defaultValue="cfn"
  values={[
	  { label: "Cloudformation", value: "cfn" },
	  { label: "Policy as JSON", value: "json" },
	  ]}
>
<TabItem value="cfn">
<h4>Setup the Cloudformation Template</h4>
Run the following commands in your terminal to create `granted-identity-sso-role.yml`, a CloudFormation template which will be deployed to your AWS account. We recommend saving this alongside your granted-deployment.yml file in source control.

```bash
IDP_SYNC_ROLE_ARN=$(gdeploy output IDPSyncExecutionRoleARN)
API_ROLE_ARN=$(gdeploy output RestAPIExecutionRoleARN)

cat << EOF > granted-identity-sso-role.yml

<h4>Deploy the Cloudformation Template</h4>
Follow either the Console or CLI deployment steps.

<Tabs
groupId="cfn-deployment"
defaultValue="cli"
values={[
  { label: "Via the AWS CLI", value: "cli" },
{ label: "Via the AWS console", value: "console" },
]}

<TabItem value="cli">
If you have the AWS CLI installed and can deploy cloudformation you can run the following commands to deploy this stack.

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file granted-identity-sso-role.yml --stack-name Granted-Identity-SSO-Role --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

Once the stack is deployed, you can retrieve the role ARN by running the following command.

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name Granted-Identity-SSO-Role --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[0].OutputValue"
```

#### Permissions Policy

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "identitystore:DescribeGroup",
        "identitystore:DescribeUser",

For the trust relationship policy, you will need replace `{{ IDPSyncExecutionRoleARN }}` and `{{ RestAPIExecutionRoleARN }}` with the values from your deployment.
You can use the following gdeploy commands to fetch the values.

```bash
gdeploy output IDPSyncExecutionRoleARN
gdeploy output RestAPIExecutionRoleARN
```

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [

      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Tags

Ensure that you add the following tag to the role so that the Granted Approvals lambda can assume it.

- Key: `common-fate-abac-role`
- Value: `aws-sso-identity-provider`

## Setting up SAML SSO

### Create the SAML Application

To get started navigate to the **Applications** tab of the AWS IAM Identity Center console.

![](/img/sso/aws-sso/add-application.png)

Click **Add application**, then select the **Add custom SAML 2.0 application** option. Click **Next** then Give your application a suitable name.

![](/img/sso/aws-sso/custom-application.png)

### Configure the SAML Application

In a terminal where your granted-deployment.yml file is, run the following command.

```bash
gdeploy identity sso saml-parameters
```

The output should look like this.

```
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       PARAMETER        |                                       VALUE                                       |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| SAML SSO URL (ACS URL) | https://cf-granted-josh-6.auth.ap-southeast-2.amazoncognito.com/saml2/idpresponse |
| Audience URI           | urn:amazon:cognito:sp:ap-southeast-2_bEIsBXsiy                                    |
| Dashboard URL          | https://d20qmwhjbabk4p.cloudfront.net                                             |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Scroll down to the **Application properties** section.

Add the Granted Approvals **Dashboard URL** from the command output to the **Application start URL** field.

Scroll down to the **Application metadata** section.

Add the Granted Approvals **SAML SSO URL (ACS URL)** from the command output to the **Application ACS URL** field.

Add the Granted Approvals **Audience URI** from the command output to the **Application SAML audience** field.

![](/img/sso/aws-sso/application-metadata.png)

Click **Next**

### Configure the SAML Attributes

Click the **Actions** menu then select the **Edit attribute mappings** option.

![](/img/sso/aws-sso/edit-attribute-mappings.png)

![](/img/sso/aws-sso/attribute-mappings.png)

On the first entry for "Subject" set the field **Maps to this string value or user attribute in IAM Identity Center** to `${user:email}`

Add a new attribute mapping.

- For **User attribute in the application**, enter: `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress`
- For **Maps to this string value or user attribute in IAM Identity Center**, enter: `${user:email}`
- For Format select `basic`

Click **Save Changes**

:::info
You'll need to assign yourself and other users to the SAML application before you can login.
:::

Use the assign user wizard to assign users or groups to the application.

![](/img/sso/aws-sso/assign-users.png)

### Setup the SAML SSO provider in your deployment

Now that you have configured the SAML application, you can use gdeploy to setup the SSO provider for your deployment.

```
gdeploy identity sso enable
```

Select **AWS Single Sign On**

Enter the ARN of the IAM role that you deployed earlier.

```
? The ARN of the AWS IAM Role with permission to administer SSO (identityStoreRoleArn)
```

#### Fetch the AWS SSO Instance ID

<Tabs
groupId="sso-values"
defaultValue="cli"
values={[
  { label: "Via the AWS CLI", value: "cli" },
{ label: "Via the AWS console", value: "console" },
]}
>

<TabItem value="cli">
If you have the AWS CLI installed and can access the account that your AWS SSO instance is deployed to, run the following command to retrieve details about the instance:

```bash
❯ aws sso-admin list-instances
{
    "Instances": [
        {
            "InstanceArn": "arn:aws:sso:::instance/ssoins-1234567890",
            "IdentityStoreId": "d-1234567890"
        }
    ]
}
```

The **IdentityStoreId** field in the CLI output should be provided as the **identityStoreId** parameter when configuring the provider.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="console">
Open the AWS console in the account that your AWS SSO instance is deployed to. If your company is using AWS Control Tower, this will be the root account in your AWS organisation.

Visit the **Settings** tab. The information about your SSO instance will be shown here, including the Instance ARN (as the “ARN” field) and the Identity Store ID.

![](https://static.commonfate.io/providers/aws/sso/console-instance-arn-setup.png)

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Enter the AWS Identity Store id

```
? The AWS SSO Identity Store ID (identityStoreId)
```

Enter the region that your Identity Store is deployed to.

```
? the region the AWS SSO instance is deployed to (region)
```

#### Fetch the SAML Application Metadata

Next you will be prompted for the SAML metadata, select **URL**

```
? Would you like to use a metadata URL, an XML string, or load XML from a file?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> URL
  String
  File
```

In the AWS console, navigate to IAM Identity Center, the Applications.

Select the application you created in the previous step.

From the **Actions** menu, select **Edit configuration**

Scroll down to the **IAM Identity Center metadata** section.

**Copy** the URL under **IAM Identity Center SAML metadata file** and enter it in the gdeploy cli when prompted for the URL.

```
? Metadata URL
```

#### Creating Granted Approvals Administrator Group

Finally you will need to create or use an existing group in AWS IAM Identity Center as an administrator group for Granted Approvals. Members of this group will have access to the admin dashboard of the application.
Enter the ID of the group in AWS IAM Identity Center which represents the administrators of Granted Approvals.

A group ID looks like this `976708da7d-b2f2e2cf-152c-4301-923f-ed6b3b9564a3` and can be found in the AWS console.

```
[!] Don't forget to assign your users to the SAML app in aws-sso so that they can login after setup is complete.
[i] When using SSO, administrators for Granted are managed in your identity provider.
        Create a group called 'Granted Administrators' in your identity provider and copy the group's ID.
        Users in this group will be able to manage Access Rules.

? The ID of the Granted Administrators group in your identity provider:
```

You should see the following prompts which indicate that you have completed setup.

You should follow the instructions to update you Granted Approvals deployment.

```
[i] Updating your deployment config
[✔] Successfully completed SSO configuration
[!] Your changes won't be applied until you redeploy. Run 'gdeploy update' to apply the changes to your CloudFormation deployment.

    Users and will be synced every 5 minutes from your identity provider. To finish enabling SSO, follow these steps:
    1) Run 'gdeploy update' to apply the changes to your CloudFormation deployment.
    2) Run 'gdeploy identity sync' to trigger an immediate sync of your user directory.
```

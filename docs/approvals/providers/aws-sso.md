# AWS SSO

## Parameters

| Name            | Description                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| identityStoreId | the AWS SSO Identity Store ID                             |
| instanceArn     | the AWS SSO Instance ARN                                  |
| region          | (optional) the region the AWS SSO instance is deployed to |

## Prerequisites

In order to use this provider, the AWS account which Granted Approvals is deployed in must be a delegated administrator of the AWS SSO instance.

To set this up, open the AWS console visit the **Settings** page in AWS SSO. Navigate to the **Management** tab. Then, click on the **Register account** button in the ‚ÄúDelegated administrator‚Äù section.

Select the account which Granted Approvals is deployed to.

<aside>
üí° Enabling this action has security implications: users with administrative access in the account that Granted Approvals is deployed in will have the ability to perform AWS SSO administrative tasks. Once Granted Approvals is set up, we recommend removing any persistent Permission Sets which grant users administrative access to the account that Granted Approvals is running in.

</aside>

A delegated administrator account does not have the ability to remove Permission Sets created in your SSO management account. For example, if you have persistent permissions defined in your management account and only use Granted Approvals for elevated administrative access, Granted Approvals will be unable to remove any persistent permissions as long as they are defined in the management account.

## Setup instructions

### Using the AWS CLI

If you have the AWS CLI installed and can access the account that your AWS SSO instance is deployed to, run the following command to retrieve details about the instance:

```bash
‚ùØ aws sso-admin list-instances
{
    "Instances": [
        {
            "InstanceArn": "arn:aws:sso:::instance/ssoins-1234567890",
            "IdentityStoreId": "d-1234567890"
        }
    ]
}
```

The `InstanceArn` value in the CLI output should be provided as the `instanceArn` parameter when configuring the provider.

The `IdentityStoreId` field in the CLI output should be provided as the `identityStoreId` parameter when configuring the provider.

If your AWS SSO instance is deployed in a separate region to the region that Granted Approvals is running in, set the `region` parameter to be the region of your AWS SSO instance (e.g. `us-east-1`).

### Using the AWS Console

Open the AWS console in the account that your AWS SSO instance is deployed to. If your company is using AWS Control Tower, this will be the root account in your AWS organisation.

Visit the **Settings** tab. The information about your SSO instance will be shown here, including the Instance ARN (as the ‚ÄúARN‚Äù field) and the Identity Store ID.

## Creating Permissions Sets for Your Access Rules

Once you have the provider configured, you will need to create some Permission Sets in the delegated administrator account which are accessible by Granted.

The AWS SSO provider is configured to only list Permission Sets which have a resource tag with key:`commonfate.io/managed-by-granted`. This means only tagged permission sets will show in the create access rule form in the Approvals UI.

It is important that these Permission Sets are in the delegated administration account otherwise access requests will fail due to a permissions error.

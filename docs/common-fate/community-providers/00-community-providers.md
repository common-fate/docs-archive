# Community Providers

Community Providers extend on the success of our original built-in Access Providers and introduce a range of new features, Python language support, a new deployment paradigm and the ability for community members to contribute their own providers more easily.

# Provider Registry

Providers are now published to the Provider Registry, a centralized service which alows Common Fate users to discover and author providers.

The Provider Registry is hosted by Common Fate with a public API available at https://api.registry.commonfate.io and landing page comming soon!

:::note
The Provider Registry is currently in alpha. Registry APIs are subject to change.

# Provider Development Kit (PDK)

The Provider Development Kit (PDK) is a Python-based framework to build Providers for Common Fate. Providers are the bridge between Common Fate and any API.

With the PDK framework, you can create workflows for just-in-time access requests with fine-grained permissions.

Common Fate maintains a range of Providers such as AWS SSO, Okta Groups, Azure Groups which you can deploy right now.

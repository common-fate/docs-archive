# Next steps

## Getting ready for production

Before using Granted Approvals with your team, we recommend completing the following steps:

1. [Configure Access Providers](/granted-approvals/providers/access-providers)
2. [Enable SSO and user directory sync](/granted-approvals/sso/introduction)
3. [Enable Slack notifications](/granted-approvals/configuration/slack)
4. [Use a custom domain for the web portal](/granted-approvals/configuration/custom-domain)

If you use a [SIEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management) to collect security logs, you can connect Granted Approvals to it to capture audit trail events.

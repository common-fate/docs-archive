# Deploying PDK Providers

:::info
To deploy a PDK Provider, you'll need to have [installed the `cf` CLI](./setup) and have valid AWS credentials in your terminal environment.
:::

PDK Providers are packaged and deployed as AWS CloudFormation templates. These templates contain:

1. A AWS Lambda function which contains the code to run the Provider. This is called the [**Handler**](./concepts#handler).
2. An AWS IAM role for the Handler, called the **Handler Role**.
3. An AWS IAM role which allows Common Fate to invoke the Lambda, called the **Invoke Role**.

## Quickstart

To deploy a new PDK Provider, use the following command:

```
cf provider deploy
```

This command will walk you through the deployment and configuration process for the Handler, and will provision a CloudFormation template which will create AWS resources. The command will prompt you to [bootstrap your AWS environment](./concepts#bootstrapping) if it has not been bootstrapped yet.

The command performs the following actions:

1. Ensures your AWS environment is [bootstrapped](./concepts#bootstrapping).
2. Copies the Provider CloudFormation template and Lambda files from the Provider Registry to the bootstrap S3 bucket.
3. Deploys the CloudFormation template for the [Handler](./concepts#handler).
4. Registers the [Handler](./concepts#handler) with Common Fate.
5. Creates a [Target Group](./concepts#target-group) to to use with [Access Rules](../configuration/access-rules)
6. Links the Handler to the Target Group.

When running this command, you should see an output similar to the below:

## Removing a Handler

To uninstall the provider and its associated items you can use the following command:

```
cf provider destroy --handler-id <handler-id> --target-group-id <target-group-id> --delete-cloudformation-stack
```

## Listing existing Providers

List all the existing providers in Provider Registry by running:

```
cf provider list
```

You can quickly view a Provider's [Schema](./concepts#schema) by running:

```
curl https://api.registry.commonfate.io/v1alpha1/providers/common-fate/aws/v0.2.0
```

## Step-by-step

Running `cf provider deploy` walks through the deployment process interactively. If you prefer, you can run commands individually to deploy a Provider.

1. Run the following command to copy the Provider assets to your bootstrap bucket:

```
> cf provider bootstrap --id <provider-id> --bootstrap-bucket=DEPLOYMENT_BUCKET
```

The `provider-id` here is the complete provider information including the publisher and version information. For example, `common-fate/aws@v.0.2.0` means publisher is `common-fate`, name is `aws` & version is `v.0.2.0`.

2. Create a new Target Group for your Provider by running:

```
cf targetgroup create --id <enter_a_unique_targetgroup_identifier> --schema-from <provider-id>
```

3. Create a new Handler for your Provider by running:

```
cf handler register --id <enter_a_unique_handler_identifier> --aws-region <your_aws_region> --aws-account <your_aws_accound_id>
```

4. You need to now link your Target Group with a Handler by running:

```
cf targetgroup link --target-group <target_group_id> --handler <handler_id> --kind <kind_name>
```

5. Deploy the CloudFormation stack for your Handler:

You can use `cf cloudformation generate create` command to interactively enter all the required cloudformation parameters and generate the `aws cloudformation create-stack` command.

```
cf cloudformation generate create --provider-id <provider_id> --handler-id <handler_id> --region <aws_region>
```

## Validating a Deployed Provider

Run the following command to check the status of your Handler:

```
cf handler validate --id <handler_id> --aws-region <region> --runtime aws-lambda
```

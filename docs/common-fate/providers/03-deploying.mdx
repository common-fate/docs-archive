# Deploying PDK Providers

:::info
To deploy a PDK Provider, you'll need to have [installed the `cf` CLI](./setup), and have valid AWS credentials in your terminal environment.
:::

PDK Providers are packaged and deployed as AWS CloudFormation templates. These templates contain:

1. An AWS Lambda function which contains the code to run the Provider. This is called the [**Handler**](./concepts#handler).
2. An AWS IAM role for the Handler, called the **Handler Role**.
3. An AWS IAM role which allows Common Fate to invoke the Lambda, called the **Invoke Role**.

## Listing existing Providers
To have a look at what providers you can deploy in your Common Fate instance take a look at [https://registry.commonfate.io/](https://registry.commonfate.io/) to see all the available providers. 

Or run the following command in your terminal to see a list.
List all the existing providers in Provider Registry by running:

```
cf provider list
```

You can quickly view a Provider's [schema](./concepts#schema) by running:

```
curl https://api.registry.commonfate.io/v1alpha1/providers/common-fate/aws/v0.2.0
```

# Deploying
There are two ways you can deploy a PDK provider. First is using the [all-in-one method](#quickstart) or can set up each part manually using the [step-by-step guide](#step-by-step)

## Quickstart
:::info
When deploying PDK providers you will want to deploy into the **same account** that your Common Fate is deployed into. 
:::

To get started login to cf using the login command:
```
cf login
```

To quickly and interactively deploy a new PDK Provider, run the following command:

```
cf provider deploy
```

This command will walk you through the deployment and configuration process for the Handler, and will provision a CloudFormation template which will create AWS resources. The command will prompt you to [bootstrap your AWS environment](./concepts#bootstrapping) if it has not been bootstrapped already.

The command performs the following actions:

1. Ensures your AWS environment is bootstrapped.
2. Copies the Provider CloudFormation template and Lambda files from the Provider Registry to the bootstrap S3 bucket.
3. Deploys the CloudFormation template for the Handler.
4. Registers the Handler with Common Fate.
5. Creates a [Target Group](./concepts#target-group) to to use with [Access Rules](../configuration/access-rules)
6. Links the Handler to the Target Group.

When running this command, you should see an output similar to the below:

## Removing a Handler

To uninstall the provider and its associated items, run the following command:

```
cf provider destroy --handler-id <handler-id> --target-group-id <target-group-id> --delete-cloudformation-stack
```


## Step-by-step

Running `cf provider deploy` walks through the deployment process interactively. If you prefer, you can run commands individually to deploy a Provider.

### 1. Copying assets

To copy the Provider assets to your bootstrap bucket, run the following command:

```
cf provider bootstrap --id <provider-id> --bootstrap-bucket=DEPLOYMENT_BUCKET
```

Here, the `provider-id` is the complete provider information including the publisher and version information. The format should take the following shape:

```bash
publisher/name@version
```

For example, `common-fate/aws@v.0.2.0` means publisher is `common-fate`, name is `aws`, and version is `v.0.2.0`.

### 2. Creating target groups

Create a new Target Group for your Provider by running:

```
cf targetgroup create --id <enter_a_unique_targetgroup_identifier> --schema-from <provider-id>
```

### 3. Creating the Handler

Create a new Handler for your Provider by running:

```
cf handler register --id <enter_a_unique_handler_identifier> --aws-region <your_aws_region> --aws-account <your_aws_accound_id>
```

### 4. Target group linking

Link your Target Group with a Handler by running:

```
cf targetgroup link --target-group <target_group_id> --handler <handler_id> --kind <kind_name>
```

### 5. Deployment

You are now ready to deploy the CloudFormation stack for your Handler. To interactively enter all the required CloudFormation parameters, run the following command:

```
cf provider generate cloudformation-create
```

Alternatively, you can prefill these fields in the following command:

```
cf cloudformation generate cloudformation-create --provider-id <provider_id> --handler-id <handler_id> --region <aws_region>
```

Both will generate the `aws cloudformation create-stack` command.

## Validating a Deployed Provider

To check the status of your Handler, run the following command:

```
cf handler validate --id <handler_id> --aws-region <region> --runtime aws-lambda
```

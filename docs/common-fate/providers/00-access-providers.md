# Access Providers

Providers are an essential part of Common Fate. Providers are plugins that allow the access management integration between Common Fate and your choice of cloud/identity service.

To configure a new provider for your Common Fate deployment, we recommend to open the Providers tab in your admin dashboard and start a new interactive setup for the provider of your choice.
This will guide you through the steps for setting up and collect all the required configuration for you ready to use with the gdeploy CLI. Here's where you can access this:

If you are just getting started with Common Fate and don't have a deployment yet, you can check out the [Provider Registry](./registry/00-provider-registry.md) which lists all the available providers with the instructions for setting them up so you can get an idea of what a Common Fate deployment will look like for you!

We highly recommend you get started with [Adding Your First Provider](/common-fate/providers/add-first-provider/first-provider). It'll walk you through how to add a test provider so you can understand the access workflow before you connect your production environments.

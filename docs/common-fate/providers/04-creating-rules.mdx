# Creating an Access Rule

Now that a provider has successfully been setup and is returning a healthy response from the server, we can create an access rule that points to that provider.

## Adding an Access Rule

Access Rules are a core component of Common Fate. They define what roles and resources particular groups can request access to, and define policies such as requiring a second person to approve the access.

To create your first access rule, open the web dashboard with the following command:

```bash
gdeploy dashboard open
```

Press the **Switch to Admin** button in the top right of the page to swap to the admin dashboard, and then press the **New Access Rule** button. You will see a screen similar to below:

Enter “Demo” for the name and “Demo” for the description, and click **Next**. You will see a screen similar to below:

Since you set up the TestVault provider in the previous step, it's now available for you to use with your Access Rules. Adding more Access Providers will give you more options to choose from in this step. For now, select **testvault**.

You'll then be prompted to set up specific options for the TestVault provider. Each provider has it's own options available for configuration, this allows you to specify the particular role or resource that you want to grant access to.

Enter “demovault” as the Vault option and click **Next**.

Specify a Maximum Duration of 1 hour and click **Next**.

Select **common_fate_administrators** as the request group and click **Next**.

Leave the Approvers section empty and click **Create**.

Common Fate won't let you approve your own access requests, so if you'd like to test out approval policies you'll need to invite a second user to your Common Fate team!

You'll be taken back to the Access Rule table, where you will see your newly created rule.

Now, let's request access!

Common Fate is an open source privileged access management framework which makes requesting access a breeze. Using Common Fate, your team members can request elevated permissions to your cloud environment and SaaS services.

Common Fate key benefits are:

- **Get access:** setup rules defining who can request access to what, and the resource owners who can approve access.

- **Connect with your services:** install Access Providers to provision access to your SaaS services and cloud providers.

- **Approve quickly:** connect with your team's communication tools like Slack.

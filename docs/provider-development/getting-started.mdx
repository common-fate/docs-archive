# Getting Started

:::info
Our Provider Development documentation is still a work-in-progress. If you're building an Access Provider, [join our Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/commonfatecommunity/shared_invite/zt-q4m96ypu-_gYlRWD3k5rIsaSsqP7QMg).
:::

Common Fate Providers are built using the Provider Development Kit, or PDK for short. The PDK consists of:

- A [`pdk` CLI](https://github.com/common-fate/pdk) to help create, test, and publish Providers
- A Python `commonfate_provider` library which is imported by all Access Providers to enable integration with the Common Fate platform

You'll use the `pdk` CLI from the command line, and the `commonfate_provider` library inside your Provider Python code.

## Install the PDK CLI

In order to use the `pdk` CLI you'll need to install it on your system. Common Fate provides binaries for `pdk` that you can download and install.

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is an open source package manager for MacOS. We publish a Homebrew formula for the `pdk`. To install the `pdk` with Homebrew, run the commands below in your terminal.

```
brew install common-fate/tap/pdk
```

Select the steps which match your system architecture. You can find your architecture by running `uname -m` from a terminal window.

sudo tar -zxvf ./pdk_0.1.1_linux_x86_64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/

```

<TabItem value="arm64">

curl -OL releases.commonfate.io/pdk/v0.1.1/pdk_0.1.1_linux_arm64.tar.gz

```

First, download the zip archive of `pdk` which matches your system's architecture. You can find your architecture by viewing your system properties in the Control Panel.

[PDK for Windows x86_64](https://releases.commonfate.io/pdk/v0.1.1/pdk_0.1.1_windows_x86_64.zip)

[PDK for Windows arm64](https://releases.commonfate.io/pdk/v0.1.1/pdk_0.1.1_windows_arm64.zip)

[PDK for Windows i386](https://releases.commonfate.io/pdk/v0.1.1/pdk_0.1.1_windows_i386.zip)

After downloading `pdk`, unzip the package.

You'll need to move `pdk` to a folder that is accessible on your `PATH`. [This StackOverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1618280/where-can-i-set-path-to-make-exe-on-windows) has instructions on how to do this.

## Verify the installation

You can verify the integrity and authenticity of the `pdk` binary you have downloaded by running through the [verification process here](/granted/security#release-verification) (replacing references to `granted` in URLs with `pdk`).

To verify that the installation has succeeded, print the version of `pdk` by running `pdk -v`. You should see an output similar to below.

```
âžœ pdk -v


pdk v0.1.1

```

If you have any issues installing don't hesitate to [ask for help on our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/commonfatecommunity/shared_invite/zt-q4m96ypu-_gYlRWD3k5rIsaSsqP7QMg).

## Testing the provider

As the `pdk` is still under development, we would like to share with you our current testing process:

To begin, please open three separate terminal tabs. In the first tab, run the command `gdeploy logs watch`. In the second tab, run the command `cf handler logs watch`. And finally, in the third tab, run the command `gdeploy cache sync`.

Once these commands are running, you can switch back to the first and second tabs where you will be able to see if any errors have occurred during testing. This will give you a better understanding of the current status of your provider.

As our development progresses, we will continue to update and improve our testing process.

## Adding dependencies

To add a Python dependency, run the following commands:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate # ensure that you are in the Python virtual environment for the Provider
pip install DEPENDENCY_NAME
pip freeze > requirements.txt # IMPORTANT: update the requirements.txt to include the new dependency
```

## Publishing the provider

We are currently working on formalizing the process for publishing to the Provider Registry. Please check back soon for updates on how to publish your Access Provider to the registry.

# Getting Started

:::info
Our Provider Development documentation is still a work-in-progress. If you're building an Access Provider, [join our Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/commonfatecommunity/shared_invite/zt-q4m96ypu-_gYlRWD3k5rIsaSsqP7QMg).
:::

Common Fate Providers are built using the Provider Development Kit, or PDK for short. The PDK consists of:

- A [`pdk` CLI](https://github.com/common-fate/pdk) to help create, test, and publish Providers
- A Python `commonfate_provider` library which all Access Providers import

You'll use the `pdk` CLI from the command line, and use `commonfate_provider` inside your Provider Python code.

## Install the PDK CLI

In order to use the `pdk` CLI you'll need to install it on your system. Common Fate provides binaries for `pdk`.

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is an open source package manager for MacOS. We publish a Homebrew formula for Granted. To install Granted with Homebrew, run the commands below in your terminal.

```
brew install common-fate/tap/pdk
```

Select the steps which match your system architecture. You can find your architecture by running `uname -m` from a terminal window.

First, download the zip archive of `pdk` which matches your system's architecture. You can find your architecture by viewing your system properties in the Control Panel.

[PDK for Windows x86_64](https://releases.commonfate.io/pdk/v0.1.1/pdk_0.1.1_windows_x86_64.zip)

[PDK for Windows arm64](https://releases.commonfate.io/pdk/v0.1.1/pdk_0.1.1_windows_arm64.zip)

[PDK for Windows i386](https://releases.commonfate.io/pdk/v0.1.1/pdk_0.1.1_windows_i386.zip)

After downloading `pdk`, unzip the package.

You'll need to move `pdk` to a folder that is accessible on your `PATH`. [This StackOverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1618280/where-can-i-set-path-to-make-exe-on-windows) has instructions on how to do this.

## Verify the installation

You can verify the integrity and authenticity of the `pdk` binary you have downloaded by running through the [verification process here](/granted/security#release-verification) (replacing references to `granted` in URLs with `pdk`).

To verify that the installation has succeeded, print the version of `pdk` by running `pdk -v`. You should see an output similar to below.

```
âžœ pdk -v


pdk v0.1.1

```

If you have any issues installing don't hesitate to [ask for help on our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/commonfatecommunity/shared_invite/zt-q4m96ypu-_gYlRWD3k5rIsaSsqP7QMg).

## Testing the provider

## Adding dependencies

To add a Python dependency, run the following commands:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate # ensure that you are in the Python virtual environment for the Provider
pip install DEPENDENCY_NAME
pip freeze > requirements.txt # IMPORTANT: update the requirements.txt to include the new dependency
```

## Publishing the provider

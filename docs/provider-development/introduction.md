# Introduction

:::info
Our Provider Development documentation is still a work-in-progress. If you're building an Access Provider, [join our Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/commonfatecommunity/shared_invite/zt-q4m96ypu-_gYlRWD3k5rIsaSsqP7QMg).
:::

Access Providers are plugins for Common Fate which connect Common Fate to other services, such as cloud providers and SaaS applications. Examples of Access Providers are an AWS Access Provider or an Okta Access Provider. Access Providers contain specific integration logic to assign users to resources.

Access Providers are written in Python. This documentation will guide you through developing your own Access Provider and publishing it to the [Provider Registry](https://registry.commonfate.io)

## Get started

Follow the [Getting Started guide](/provider-development/getting-started) to start building an Access Provider.

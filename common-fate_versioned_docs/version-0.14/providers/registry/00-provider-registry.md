# Provider Registry

Common Fate currently develops a range of providers to manage access to different cloud resources.

[commonfate/aws-sso@v2](commonfate/aws-sso/v2/setup)

[commonfate/azure-ad@v1](commonfate/azure-ad/v1/setup)

[commonfate/ecs-exec-sso@v1-alpha1](commonfate/ecs-exec-sso/v1-alpha1/setup)

[commonfate/okta@v1](commonfate/okta/v1/setup)

Let us know if you have a provider you want added!

We are working toward supporting Community providers which will enable teams to build their own providers for anything such as internal tools.

# Next steps

## Getting ready for production

Before using Common Fate with your team, we recommend completing the following steps:

1. [Configure Access Providers](/common-fate/providers/providers)
2. [Enable SSO and user directory sync](/common-fate/sso/sso-setup)
3. [Enable Slack notifications](/common-fate/configuration/slack)
4. [Use a custom domain for the web portal](/common-fate/configuration/custom-domain)

If you use a [SIEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management) to collect security logs, you can connect Common Fate to it to capture audit trail events.

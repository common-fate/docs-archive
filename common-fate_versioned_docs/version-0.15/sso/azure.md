# Azure AD

:::info
Common Fate user and group sync requires some credentials to be configured in your identity provider account. Common Fate uses 2LO authentication to read users and groups from your directory and sync them to an internal database every 5 minutes.
:::

## Azure AD setup

### Creating Access Tokens in Azure

To set up Azure to sync users and groups with Common Fate we will need to create an access token to communicate with Azure's Graph API.

Sign in to your Azure portal as a user with [administrator privileges](https://portal.azure.com).

In the Console, search or select **App Registrations** from the list of resources on Azure and then select the **New registration** to make a new App.
![](/img/sso/azure/app-registrations.png)

Name the app 'Granted Directory Sync', Accounts in this organizational directory only (single tenant) for **Supported account types** and then click **Register**.

![](/img/sso/azure/registernew.png)

Your app will be shown in a table of other owned applications in azure. Click on the newly created app and we will now configure some scopes and create an access token.

### Adding API Scopes

Next, click on **API permissions** in the tabs on the left hand side. Click on **Add a permission**

![](/img/sso/azure/perms.png)

- Use Application permissions from **Microsoft Graph**
- Search for **User** and add: `User.Read.All`
- Then search for **Group** and add: `Group.Read.All`
- Finally search for **GroupMember** and add: `GroupMember.Read.All`
- Once you have selected the permissions click **Add permissions** to add them to your application.

Make sure you click **Grant admin consent** above the permissions table and permit the scopes on the application.

### Running Gdeploy Commands

This is where we can start up the `gdeploy identity sso enable` command. Run the following to begin the SSO setup:

```json
gdeploy identity sso enable
```

Select 'Azure' when prompted for the identity provider.

```json
? The SSO provider to deploy with  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
  Google
  Okta
> Azure
```

Head back to the **Overview** tab in the Azure portal, and get the first two IDs from the Essentials section.
![](/img/sso/azure/new.png)

`gdeploy` will prompt you for IDs relating to your Azure AD tenancy.

1. For the `Tenant ID` param, copy and paste the **Directory (tenant) ID**.
2. For the `Client ID` param, copy and paste the **Application (client) ID**.

`Email Identifier` is an optional configuration. Used to specify which field on an Azure user object corresponds to the user's email address, this changes occasionally in deployments.
For more infomation about this see the Azure documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0#properties)

** - If you don't know which field for your tenancy you can leave this blank. **

Next we will create a token, for this head into the **Certificates & secrets** tab in the left hand Nav, Under Client secrets. Create a new secret.

Give the secret a descriptive name, like `Granted-token`. It will create a secret and display a table showing the secret value.

Copy the secret value and use it for the **Client Secret** input in the `gdeploy` sso setup.

You should see an output similar to the below.

```
[✔] SSM Parameters set successfully
[i] The following parameters are required to setup a SAML app in your identity provider
+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
|    OUTPUT PARAMETER    |                          VALUE                          |
+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| SAML SSO URL (ACS URL) | demo.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com/saml2/idpresponse |
| Audience URI           | urn:amazon:cognito:sp:us-west-2_abcdefghi               |
+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
```

Next you will need to set up a SAML app. When`gdeploy` prompts you for SAML metadata, select the "URL" option.

```
? Would you like to use a metadata URL, an XML string, or load XML from a file?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> URL
  String
  File
```

You will see something like this, follow the [next section](#setting-up-saml-sso) to get the XML metadata required for this step.

```
? Metadata URL
```

## Setting up SAML SSO

To get started navigate to the **Enterprise applications** resource in the Azure console.

Click **New application**, then **Create your own application**. Call your app 'Granted SSO', and select the 'Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery)' option. Once done click **Create**

In the newly created enterprise application select **Single sign-on** from the left navbar

![](/img/sso/azure/SAML.png)

Then click the **SAML** sign on method from the options.
![](/img/sso/azure/SAML-conf.png)

Set the **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** value in Azure AD to be the **SAML SSO URL (ACS URL)** from the gdeploy outputs

Set the **Identifier (Entity ID)** value in Azure AD to be the **Audience URI (Entity ID)** from `gdeploy`

The outputs will look like this:

```bash
[!] SAML outputs:
+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
|    OUTPUT PARAMETER    |                          VALUE                          |
+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| SAML SSO URL (ACS URL) | demo.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com/saml2/idpresponse |
| Audience URI           | urn:amazon:cognito:sp:us-west-2_abcdefghi               |
+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
```

Hit save.

From the same page, in the **Attributes & Claims** section we will want to edit the default attributes for _emailaddress_.
![](/img/sso/azure/attributes.png)

- By default the emailaddress attribute will be linked to user.mail. We want to change this to user.userprincipalname.

Click edit and it will take you to this screen.
![](/img/sso/azure/claims.png)

Click on the email attribute value and you will be taken to this screen, from here change the value to user.userprincipalname
![](/img/sso/azure/edit-claim.png)

Then from the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, copy the **App Federation metadata Url**
![](/img/sso/azure/saml-url.png)

Paste this URL into the gdeploy prompt asking for `Metadata Url`

Finally you will need to create an adminitrator group with granted. You will be asked for `The ID of the Granted Administrators group in your identity provider:`

To get this group ID we will need to make the administrator group in Azure.

### Creating Common Fate Administrator Group

In the Azure portal, to to _Groups_.

![](/img/sso/azure/groups.png)

Click the **New group** button

![](/img/sso/azure/new-group.png)

- Make it a **Security Group**
- Name the group the same name as you set in the `gdeploy` config setup.

- Add yourself as a owner and any others you want to make granted admins for the members of the group.
  Hit **Create Group** at the end to complete.

Click on the newly created Group once it has been created and you will be taken to this screen:
![](/img/sso/azure/created-group.png)

Copy the **Object Id**. Use this for the group Id prompt in gdeploy.
Press enter and this should conclude the gdeploy set up for SSO/SAMl sign on in azure.

You should see the following:

```
[i] Updating your deployment config
[✔] Successfully completed SSO configuration
[!] Your changes won't be applied until you redeploy. Run 'gdeploy update' to apply the changes to your CloudFormation deployment.

Users and will be synced every 5 minutes from your identity provider. To finish enabling SSO, follow these steps:
 1) Run 'gdeploy update' to apply the changes to your CloudFormation deployment.
 2) Run 'gdeploy identity sync' to trigger an immediate sync of your user directory.
```

You will need to redeploy using `gdeploy update` to update the identity provider changes.

## Customising the Azure AD email attribute

By default, Common Fate uses an Azure user's [UserPrincipalName (UPN)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/plan-connect-userprincipalname) as the email attribute when syncing an Azure AD directory. This can be overridden to another attribute, such as mail, by setting the azure entry in your `deployment.yml` file as follows:

```diff
deployment:
  parameters:
    IdentityConfiguration:
      azure:
        tenantId: 12345-12345-12345-12345
        clientId: 12345-12345-12345-12345
        clientSecret: awsssm:///granted/secrets/identity/azure/secret:1
+       emailIdentifier: mail
```

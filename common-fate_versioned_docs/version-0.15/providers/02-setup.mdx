# PDK Provider Setup

In Common Fate v0.15+, Providers built with the [Provider Development Kit (PDK)](https://github.com/common-fate/commonfate-provider-core) are deployed separately to a Common Fate deployment.

## Installing `cf`

To deploy a PDK Provider, start by installing `cf`.

:::info
`cf` version above 0.4.0 has all the PDK related commands inside the `cf oss` subcommand.
:::

`cf` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for performing authenticated actions against a Common Fate deployment. It provides commands for creating and updating Target Groups, Handlers, Routes and also for operational tasks like viewing Handler logs.

To install `cf`, follow the instructions below based on your computer's operating system:

  { label: "Linux", value: "linux" },
  { label: "Windows", value: "windows" },
  ]}

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is an open source package manager for MacOS. We publish a Homebrew formula for `cf`. To install `cf` with Homebrew, run the commands below in your terminal.

```
brew install common-fate/tap/cf
```

First, download the zip archive of `cf` which matches your system's architecture. You can find your architecture by viewing your system properties in the Control Panel.

[cf for Windows x86_64](https://releases.commonfate.io/cf/v0.3.3/cf_0.3.3_windows_x86_64.zip)

[cf for Windows arm64](https://releases.commonfate.io/cf/v0.3.3/cf_0.3.3_windows_arm64.zip)

[cf for Windows i386](https://releases.commonfate.io/cf/v0.3.3/cf_0.3.3_windows_i386.zip)

After downloading cf, unzip the package.

You'll need to move the binary to a folder which is accessible on your `PATH`. [This StackOverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1618280/where-can-i-set-path-to-make-exe-on-windows) has instructions on how to do this.

## Verify the installation

You can verify the integrity and authenticity of the `cf` binary you have downloaded by running through the [verification process here](/granted/security#release-verification). You will need to replace references to `granted` in URLs with `cf`.

Check that `cf` has been installed correctly by running the following command:

```
cf -v
```

You should see a version output similar to the below:

```
cf version 0.3.3
```
